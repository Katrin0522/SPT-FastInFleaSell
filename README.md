# FastSellInFlea

Quickly add items on the flea market with automatic fitting of the current price

## How it works

- In the context menu of an item, a price tag is added to the **Add Offer** button if you press **LeftShift**(Default keybind).
- If you press the button with the keybind held down, the offer is added instantly, without going to the add offerer screen.
- The price is automatically setup from the current prices of the flea market.
- You can select a preset target price on the market, as well as set an amount to subtract from that base price (adjusted price).

## Installation
Extract BepInEx folder from 7z to Game Root directory. Profit!

## Notes
- If Shift is not held, the button works as a normal add-offer action.
